#### Note: Node.js has no built-in XML library. This lesson uses the `xml2js` npm package for parsing. XML generation is done with string building. Run `npm install xml2js` once before running the program. Unlike Go's `encoding/xml`, JavaScript has no native struct-to-XML mapping; XML handling requires a third-party package.
